Tender Evaluation 

The tender evaluation process for being invited to join the framework contract and being offered funding for your proposal contained in your tender for Phase 1 is set out below will be led by Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA). 

D1. Pre sift
Once you have submitted your tender, it will go through an initial sift to be considered both for inclusion on the framework and to obtain funding under Phase 1. 
Your tender will be rejected for inclusion on the framework and Phase 1 if any of the following are evident:
It does not demonstrate a realistic plan for the technology to reach Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by the end of Phase 1 or it does not demonstrate that it has already reached TRL 6 or;
it does not address the majority of the deliverables for the Lot/s as set out in Schedule 2- Schedule of Requirement or;
It is a resubmission of a previous proposal and does not adhere to the resubmission guidelines or;
It does not demonstrate acceptance of or comply with the Terms and Conditions as set out in the Standardised Contracting Terms contained within this document. Please note that there is no negotiation permitted on the Terms and Conditions of the Framework as set out in the Standardised Contracting Terms contained within this document.
It exceeds the funding limit or timescale stipulated for Phase 1 in accordance with Schedule 2-Schedule of Requirements contained within this document
Incomplete document set in accordance with the requirements of this Invitation to Tender
Further guidance on pre-sift criteria is described in the online submission service for the specific competition and in the relevant competition document. 
D2. Assessment
After the pre-sift, experts from across UK government will be assigned to assess your proposal. When people outside of UK Government are used for assessment, it will be under a nondisclosure agreement and details will be provided in advance in the relevant competition document.
During the assessment phase all proposals are assessed against the following criteria:
desirable: strategic fit, end user support/pull
feasible: technical credibility, innovation, risk, expertise of team/capability
viable: costs and value for money, project delivery/plan 
Further guidance on assessment criteria is listed below at D8. 

D8. Assessment criteria
DASA uses three baseline assessment criteria; desirable, feasible and viable. The baseline criteria apply to all our competitions, unless stated in the competition document. It is important to note that criteria may be adjusted or weighted differently across competitions in accordance with the needs of Government customers. You should check the specific guidance that is provided within the competition document.
Once the criteria have been published for a particular competition, they will remain frozen for the duration of that competition.
Corresponding guidance on what we need to see in the various sections of your proposal is provided in the proposal template on our on-line submission service.
In order to give you the best chance of success, please find below guidance on how your proposal shall be assessed.  This includes examples of the key features our assessors consider when assessing performance against the three baseline criteria. 
Desirable
DASA funds innovations that solve defence and security challenges.  Within your proposal assessors give consideration to factors including the proposal's alignment with a strategic need or challenge and who would benefit from the innovation. Evidence of end user buy-in for the idea is further considered. Ideas that are useful for both defence and security should be acknowledged.
Under this category, your tender will be assessed on: 
Defence and security compatibility.
the proposal shows benefit across defence and/or security sectors. 
Strategic fit
the proposal is clear on the business need, technological challenge or market opportunity driving the innovation.
the proposal describes the impact for defence and/or security in terms of performance, time and cost
the proposal has a clear link to a user need or challenge. This may be the challenge as specified in the competition document
End user pull
the proposal identifies who would benefit from and exploit the innovation if successful
the proposal may include letters of support as evidence that the potential customer or end user will actively support the project
the proposal outlines how the proposer expects to take the solution to market on completion of the project and who the appropriate partners would be to do so. This may include information on further phases of development or funding required for the solution to reach an appropriate TRL for procurement 


Feasible
The assessors will evaluate the likelihood of the proposal delivering a successful technical outcome.
The assessor shall consider whether the proposal is scientifically, technically and practically feasible, how innovative the idea is, and how it compares with potential alternatives. A clear and logical plan, backed by relevant expertise, capability and appropriate resources needs to be present.
Under this category, your tender will be assessed on: 
Technical Credibility
the proposal is scientifically, technically and practically feasible
the proposal has a robust testing regime with clear and quantifiable measures of progress and performance
Innovation and risk
the proposal assesses how the solution compares to alternative solutions in terms of time, cost and performance
the proposal assesses and provides mitigations for technical risks - to note DASA welcomes proposals that are high risk, high reward, but mitigations should be explained thoroughly
Expertise and capability
the proposal provides evidence of the team's relevant expertise and experience in the technical area of the innovation, including background research and projects completed
the proposal provides evidence of the resources available to the team to deliver the project including facilities and labour
Viable
The assessor will look for and evaluate evidence that the idea can be delivered within the project scope and timelines.
This will include looking for evidence of a robust project plan which identifies any links or dependencies between work packages and milestones, and which clearly identifies measurable deliverables. The assessor will also be looking at overall costs and value for money, and lastly the assessor will review the proposer's plans to take their innovation forward beyond the project.
Under this category, your tender will be assessed on:
Project Delivery
the proposal has a project plan in sufficient detail and identifies any links or dependencies between work packages and/or milestones
the proposal identifies any project risks or dependencies and has identified appropriate mitigations
the proposal identifies any need for Government Furnished Assets (GFA) (including Government Furnished Information (GFI)). Should GFA not be granted, the proposal identifies suitable alternatives
the proposal identifies any legal or ethical concerns including MODREC approval, RIPA, data protection and has put in place appropriate steps and timescales to heed these considerations
Costs and Value for Money
the proposal provides detail on the total project cost, and the profiling of spend across milestones 
the proposal explains what alternative sources of funding have been considered and what funding would be sought should the proposal be unsuccessful
the proposal provides information on any additional funding or in-kind support that has been or is being provided by anyone other than the proposer
the proposal explains what would happen to the innovation if it were not publicly funded
the proposal describes the benefit and value for money for government, and also explains any wider value to the UK economy
    Your prices submitted must:
    Be firm
∙    Exclude VAT
∙    Be inclusive of expenses/travel and subsistence 
∙    Be in British Pounds Sterling up to two decimal places

You do not have to submit a price if you are bidding for Lot 3.

Plan Beyond the Project
the proposal outlines what funding and/or customer support is potentially available to develop and incorporate the outcomes of this project
the proposal explains what tests, accreditation, trials would be necessary to take the project forward on completion of the project
the proposal considers how the outcomes could be integrated into existing systems and capabilities or outlines the solution that it would be replacing and why
the proposal estimates the long term cost of further development of the solution and any potential pricing models for procurement.
D9. Scoring Criteria


Each of the assessment criteria will be scored using the Scoring Criteria at Table 1 below. As stated in D3, after assessment, a Moderator will compile an overview of all assessments, pulling together comments to provide a collective outcome. This will include a Moderator score, These scores will all be considered when making a final decision on whether to award funding at the Decision Conference. Here, based on the scores, as well as budget and wider strategic considerations, a decision will be made on the proposals that are funded.

D10. Evaluation Process for Phase 2 ‘Spirals’ Tenders 

Please note that we are not accepting tenders for Phase 2 at this stage. Once Phase 1 has concluded, companies who are on the framework will be invited to bid for work under Phase 2. For information only, below is how the evaluation process for Phase 2 will work.
The tender evaluation process as set out below will be led by Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) after Phase 1 has concluded. 
Evaluation of tenders for the Spiral competitions under Phase 2 will be assessed on the basis of Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT). MEAT is defined as the tenderer (or tenderers if the budget permits) with the highest score(s) which comprises the following criteria: technical, price and commercial. 

Technical: specific questions for each Spiral tasking will be set for the supplier to answer in his tender. The scoring criteria for the technical questions is set out at Table 1 below.
